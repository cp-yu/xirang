Our philosophy:

```text
→ fluid not rigid
→ iterative not waterfall
→ easy not complex
→ built for brownfield not just greenfield
→ scalable from personal projects to enterprises
```

> [!TIP]
> **New workflow now available!** We've rebuilt OpenSpec with a new artifact-guided workflow.
>
> Run `/opsx:propose "your idea"` to get started. → [Learn more here](docs/opsx.md)

## Quick Start

**Requires Node.js 22.22.3 or higher.**

Install the packaged release tarball from GitHub Releases:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/cp-yu/opsx/releases/download/v1.4.1-cpyu.5/fission-ai-openspec-1.4.1-cpyu.5.tgz
```

For future versions, replace both occurrences of `1.4.1-cpyu.5` with the release tag you want to pin.

Then navigate to your project directory and initialize:

```bash
cd your-project
openspec init
```

Now tell your AI: `/opsx:propose <what-you-want-to-build>`

For vague or multi-subsystem ideas, start with `/opsx:explore`. Explore now runs a structured brainstorming flow and produces a Design Summary in chat. `/opsx:propose` can reuse that summary, or skip explore when your input is already detailed.

`/opsx:apply` now reads coarse `tasks.md` entries and has the current agent execute pending behavior checks through strict red/green TDD before marking evidence-backed progress. When run on `main` or `master`, it asks whether to create a feature branch, create a worktree, or continue on the current branch.

OpenSpec installs managed workflow skills by default, including `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:explore`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:archive`, `/opsx:bootstrap-arch`, and `/opsx:snack`. Specs and LikeC4 form the durable semantic source; `/opsx:archive` verifies and synchronizes behavior plus architecture deltas.

> [!NOTE]
> OpenSpec's managed workflow surface is **skills-only**. `openspec init` and `openspec update` install and refresh skill files under `.<tool>/skills/`. Slash command files may still exist from older installations; they remain on disk as legacy artifacts and OpenSpec no longer generates, refreshes, or removes them.

> [!NOTE]
> Not sure if your tool is supported? [View the full list](docs/supported-tools.md) – we support 20+ tools and growing.
>
> Also works with Nix. [See installation options](docs/installation.md).

## Why OpenSpec?

AI coding assistants are powerful but unpredictable when requirements live only in chat history. OpenSpec adds a lightweight spec layer so you agree on what to build before any code is written.

- **Agree before you build** — human and AI align on specs before code gets written
- **Stay organized** — each change gets its own folder with proposal, specs, design, and tasks
- **Work fluidly** — update any artifact anytime, no rigid phase gates
- **Use your tools** — works with 20+ AI assistants via managed skills

### How we compare

**vs. [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)** (GitHub) — Thorough but heavyweight. Rigid phase gates, lots of Markdown, Python setup. OpenSpec is lighter and lets you iterate freely.

**vs. [Kiro](https://kiro.dev)** (AWS) — Powerful but you're locked into their IDE and limited to Claude models. OpenSpec works with the tools you already use.

**vs. nothing** — AI coding without specs means vague prompts and unpredictable results. OpenSpec brings predictability without the ceremony.

## Updating OpenSpec

**Reinstall from GitHub Releases**

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/cp-yu/opsx/releases/download/v1.4.1-cpyu.5/fission-ai-openspec-1.4.1-cpyu.5.tgz
```

**Refresh agent instructions**

Run this inside each project to regenerate AI guidance and refresh the managed workflow skills:

```bash
openspec update
```

For a newer release, replace the version in the tarball URL and reinstall before running `openspec update`.

## Usage Notes

**Model selection**: OpenSpec works best with high-reasoning models for exploration, proposal, design, and apply. Apply uses reviewer and optimizer subagents for judgment gates, not coding execution.

**Context hygiene**: OpenSpec benefits from a clean context window. Clear your context before starting implementation and maintain good context hygiene throughout your session.

## Contributing

**Small fixes** — Bug fixes, typo corrections, and minor improvements can be submitted directly as PRs.

**Larger changes** — For new features, significant refactors, or architectural changes, please submit an OpenSpec change proposal first so we can align on intent and goals before implementation begins.

When writing proposals, keep the OpenSpec philosophy in mind: we serve a wide variety of users across different coding agents, models, and use cases. Changes should work well for everyone.

**AI-generated code is welcome** — as long as it's been tested and verified. PRs containing AI-generated code should mention the coding agent and model used (e.g., "Generated with Claude Code using claude-opus-4-5-20251101").

### Development

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Build: `pnpm run build`
- Test: `pnpm test`
- Develop CLI locally: `pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run dev:cli`
- Conventional commits (one-line): `type(scope): subject`

<summary><strong>Telemetry</strong></summary>

OpenSpec collects anonymous usage stats.

We collect only command names and version to understand usage patterns. No arguments, paths, content, or PII. Automatically disabled in CI.

**Opt-out:** `export OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` or `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`
