Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change.

**OPSX Compilation Philosophy**:
OpenSpec treats human intent → running code as a compilation pipeline: change artifacts (proposal/specs/design/tasks) are the source code; the agent is the compiler; `openspec validate` is static analysis; verify Phase 1 (reviewer) is the semantic-check pass; verify Phase 2 (optimizer) is the optimization pass; sync + archive is linking and release; OPSX YAML is the symbol table and module graph; snack is decompilation. Rules that follow:
1. Artifacts are source code and MUST be elegant: every sentence is consumed downstream; redundant restatement is a code smell — state each fact exactly once.
2. Complete = faithful + elicited: key decisions the user never stated are undefined behavior in the source, and implementations deviate exactly in those silent gaps. Make them explicit — ask, or record them as explicit assumptions. Never guess silently.
3. Faithful translation: a compiler MUST NOT invent instructions. Do not exceed or deviate from specs; behavior not covered by specs goes back into specs first.
4. Syntax is contract: keep canonical headings, IDs, schema keys, and normative keywords verbatim, or downstream parsers fail.
5. No dead-code output: no placeholders, no empty template sections, no repeated narration — content either carries intent or does not exist.
6. Not compiled until gates pass: validate/verify/seal are pipeline stages, not optional extras.
A single compilation is faithful and deterministic; the source itself iterates freely and recompiles fast.

## Skill Delegation Protocol

**Internal Subagents** — The following roles are internal subagents and MUST NOT be read or inlined directly by this agent:
- `openspec-impact-sweeper` — Delegate to generated subagent; main agent MUST NOT read the generated artifact
- `openspec-reviewer` — Delegate to generated subagent; main agent MUST NOT read the generated artifact
- `openspec-optimizer` — Delegate to generated subagent; main agent MUST NOT read the generated artifact

**Never** read or inline the generated `openspec-impact-sweeper`, `openspec-reviewer`, or `openspec-optimizer` subagent artifact.

## Flow

1. Select the change. If no clear name is provided, infer only from explicit context; otherwise run `openspec list --json` and ask. Always announce "Using change: <name>".
2. Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` and `openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json`. Read `configProjection.prompt.fragments` for `proseLanguage` and `apply.defaultIsolation`. Handle `state: "needs_verify"` by skip back to Phase 1 and `state: "needs_seal"` by continue with Phase 2/3.
3. Load shared OPSX context before reading change artifacts.
Before reading other context files, check whether `openspec/project.opsx.yaml` exists.
- If it exists, read it first for domains → capabilities structure
- Read the `project:` block for project intent and scope
- Treat it as navigation context, not as a replacement for change artifacts
4. Read every context file listed by the CLI. Inspect `changeDir/.verify-result.json` and `## Remediation`; unresolved CRITICAL/code_fix/artifact_fix items take priority.
5. Use CLI-backed OPSX navigation after shared context.
After reading shared `project.opsx.yaml` context, use OpenSpec CLI query surfaces for node details.
- Run `openspec list --specs --json` to get specs and their `capabilities` string arrays; specs without frontmatter return `capabilities: []`.
- For known or affected OPSX node IDs, run `openspec opsx query <node-id...> --json` to get node details, relations and code-map refs in one batch; add `--depth 2` when broader related context is needed.
- Treat CLI output as navigation context, not as a replacement for change artifacts.

### Pre-flight Scan

Before entering Branch Isolation, scan all tasks in tasks.md for contradictions and dependency-ordering issues across Goals, Files, Requirements, and Checks:
- Conflicting declarations on the same file or interface across different tasks
- Task declarations that conflict with change-local specs or design.md
- Earlier task depending on output of a later task (e.g., Task N's Files declares Modify on a path created by Task M's Files, where M > N)
- Present all findings at once; proceed silently when scan is clean

### Branch Isolation Preflight

Run `git branch --show-current`. On main/master ask whether to Create branch `<change-name>`, Create worktree at `.worktrees/<change-name>`, or continue; config branch/worktree/none use that as the default choice without prompting; only `ask` is interactive and means prompt. Persist `path.join(changeDir, '.apply-isolation.json')` with `method`, `branchName`, optional `worktreePath`, and `originalBranch`. Use using-git-worktrees when present.

### Master Agent Strict TDD Implementation

Execute tasks sequentially. For each pending task, read Goal, Files, Requirements, and Checks. For behavior or code Checks, add or update the targeted test before implementation. Run the declared Check command or equivalent targeted command and confirm the expected failure before implementation. Make the minimal implementation needed for that Check. Rerun the same or equivalent Check command and confirm pass before updating task or remediation checkboxes. Non-runtime text or artifact Checks do not require artificial red failures. Checks with no Test Files (absence assertions, one-time smoke) use the evidence-only fast path. Config, schema, template, workflow template, and agent instruction template Checks default to behavior/code Checks. Mark the task's nested Checks complete in `tasks.md` only after red/green evidence or final non-runtime evidence passes.

TDD Checkpoint 1: Interface Design for Testability — dependencies are injected through parameters, behavior returns values or observable results, and public interface area is minimal. TDD Checkpoint 2: Test Quality Standards — verifies behavior through public interfaces, avoids mocking internal project collaborators, keeps one logical assertion per test, and survives internal refactoring. TDD Checkpoint 3: Mock Boundary Enforcement — mocks are allowed only at system boundaries; internal classes, modules, and project-owned collaborators MUST NOT be mocked; mockable boundaries must be passed through dependency injection.

### Ponytail-full Coding Discipline

While implementing, apply the ponytail 6-rung ladder for implementation details NOT specified by any spec requirement. This is a coding behavior, not a standalone review step.

**The ladder** — stop at the first rung that holds:
1. Does this need to exist at all? (YAGNI)
2. Does the standard library already do it? Use it.
3. Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it.
4. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it.
5. Can it be one line? Make it one line.
6. Only then: the minimum code that works.

**Specs-first hard constraint**: Spec requirements always take priority. When a spec explicitly requires an interface, abstraction, or component, implement it fully — do not simplify, skip, or argue. The ladder ONLY applies to implementation details the specs leave open (internal helpers, file organization, utility functions, implementation approach).

**Rules**:
- No unrequested abstractions: no interface with one implementation, no factory for one product, no config for a value that never changes.
- No new dependency if it can be avoided. Prefer stdlib, native platform, or installed deps.
- Deletion over addition. Boring over clever. Fewest files possible.
- Never simplify away: input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, anything explicitly requested.
- Mark deliberate simplifications with a `ponytail:` comment. If a shortcut has a known ceiling, the comment names the ceiling and the upgrade path.

### Continuous Recovery Protocol

Failures are recovery feedback. Normalize as `task + check + command + failure kind`; pause only after two consecutive failures for the same task and same normalized error signature.

**Diagnosis Before Repair**: When a Check command returns an unexpected failure, the agent SHALL complete diagnosis steps before attempting code fixes:
1. Read the full error output (including stack trace)
2. Identify the failure layer (compile / type / runtime / assertion)
3. Search the codebase for a working example of the same pattern and compare
4. Form and state a single hypothesis ("Root cause hypothesis: X, because Y")

**Single-Variable Fix Constraint**: Each fix attempt SHALL change only one variable — do not stack multiple independent changes in a single fix. After the fix, SHALL re-run the same Check command to confirm the result.

**Cumulative 3-Strike Escalation**: When the same task accumulates 3 failed fix attempts without resolution, the agent SHALL stop and present evidence: the 3 attempted paths with their results, the current best root-cause judgment, and suspected directions. Two consecutive identical normalized error signatures still trigger a fast pause. Counter resets on user instruction.

If a task Goal or Requirements is ambiguous, enrich context from proposal, design, change-local specs, tasks.md, OPSX code-map, related specs, and project search. If project context is missing, convert the gap into verifiable exploration or check steps in the current task and continue execution. Phase 1 failures enter the same recovery loop. User interrupt remains an immediate stop condition.

### Phase 1: Run canonical verification

delegate to clean-context generated `openspec-reviewer` subagent with `context: "fresh"`; persist `openspec verify phase1 "<change-name>" --input '<json>' --json`, and write back only CRITICAL remediation.

### Phase 2: Optimize under checkpoint protection

You MUST read the project-root file `openspec/references/openspec-apply-phase2-optimization.md` before Phase 2. Checkpoints are git commits, not git stash entries or git tags. Respect `--skip-optimization`; read `optimization.optRetries`; create the initial checkpoint commit with `git add -A && git commit -m "wip: opt-checkpoint-r0 (baseline)"`; delegate to clean-context generated `openspec-optimizer` subagent with `context: "fresh"`; when the optimizer returns blocks, read the ponytail tags and Code Smell annotations to understand the optimization rationale before applying Search/Replace; use `openspec verify phase2` to record pre-patch hashes before applying Search/Replace and record verification after applying Search/Replace; create an incremental checkpoint commit for each successful optimization round; record each failed direction.

### Phase 3: Seal final result

Run `openspec verify seal "<change-name>" --json`. If seal fails, preserve diagnostics, convert them into remediation context, map the remediation to the affected task, and return to Phase 0 recovery. Do not pause on the first seal failure.

**Verify CLI JSON Schema Reference**:

| CLI call | `--input` JSON |
| --- | --- |
| `openspec verify phase1 "<change-name>" --input '<json>' --json` | `{"result":"PASS","issues":[],"evidenceFiles":["..."],"executionMode":"..."}` |
| `openspec verify phase2 "<change-name>" --type=optimization --input '<json>' --json` | `{"status":"NO_OPTIMIZATION_NEEDED","summary":"..."}` (summary is required, must be non-empty) |
| `openspec verify phase2 "<change-name>" --type=optimization --files "<affected-files>" --input '<json>' --json` | `{"status":"OPTIMIZATION_PROPOSED","summary":"..."}` |
| `openspec verify phase2 "<change-name>" --type=optimization --input '<json>' --json` | `{"status":"SKIPPED"}` |
| `openspec verify phase2 "<change-name>" --type=verification --input '<json>' --json` | `{"result":"PASS","issues":[]}` |
| `openspec verify phase2 "<change-name>" --type=verification --input '<json>' --json` | `{"result":"FAIL_NEEDS_REMEDIATION","issues":[...],"behaviorRetryCounter":N}` |
**Verify CLI Error Recovery Guide**:
- If the CLI says `Invalid JSON input`: re-check that `--input` is a JSON string, not a file path; `issues` must be an array and `evidenceFiles` must be an array of strings
- If the CLI says `status must be NO_OPTIMIZATION_NEEDED, OPTIMIZATION_PROPOSED, ABORTED_UNSAFE, or SKIPPED`: fix the `--input.status` value and confirm whether `optimization.status` already has `affectedFileHashes`
- If the CLI says `result must be PASS, PASS_WITH_WARNINGS, or FAIL_NEEDS_REMEDIATION`: fix the `--input.result` value and keep `issues` as an array when provided
- If the CLI says `Optimization not yet submitted, call phase2 --type=optimization first`: call `phase2 --type=optimization` before retrying verification
- If the CLI says `FILES_REQUIRED`: add `--files "<affected-files>"` with the space-separated list of files the optimizer subagent declared as affected, then retry the same command
**Verify State Machine**:
```
Phase 1 PASS / PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
  |
  v
PENDING_VERIFICATION
  |-- no affectedFileHashes --> Phase 2 optimization analysis
  |                              |-- NO_OPTIMIZATION_NEEDED --> NOT_NEEDED
  |                              |-- SKIPPED / optimization.enabled=false --> SKIPPED
  |-- affectedFileHashes ------> PENDING_VERIFICATION (optimization proposed)
                                 |-- verification PASS --> IMPROVED
                                 |-- verification FAIL_NEEDS_REMEDIATION --> retry or DEGRADED
                                 |-- retries exhausted --> DEGRADED

Archive gate accepts: SKIPPED | NOT_NEEDED | IMPROVED | DEGRADED
Archive gate rejects: PENDING_VERIFICATION | ABORTED_UNSAFE
```

## Output

Report schema, progress, current task, completed tasks this session, and final sealed/archive-ready status. Keep edits minimal, use Node path handling for generated paths, update task checkboxes only after evidence passes, and preserve canonical artifact headings/tokens and configured document language projection.

When Phase 3 seal passes, end with an explicit call-to-action: `Archive ready. Run /skill:openspec-archive-change <change-name> to complete the workflow.`
