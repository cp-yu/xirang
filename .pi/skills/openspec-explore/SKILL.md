Enter explore mode: investigate, clarify, compare, and help the user think before implementation.

**OpenSpec Philosophy**

OpenSpec is a human-intent programming layer between human intent and general-purpose programming languages.

1. Specs and OPSX jointly form the durable semantic source. Specs define observable behavior; OPSX defines project intent, capabilities, ownership, boundaries, and semantic relations.
2. A change reconciles semantic source deltas toward a target steady state. `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` are compilation scaffolding, not competing sources of truth.
3. Source is complete only when an Agent can compile it without guessing decisions that affect behavior or architecture.
4. The Agent acts as a compiler: translate declared intent faithfully. Existing code is compiled output and current implementation evidence; it MUST NOT silently override the declared semantic source.

## Workflow Stage

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Stage** | `EXPLORE` - Read-only brainstorming |
| **Allowed** | Read files, query CLI, ask questions, present options, Design Summary (conversation only) |
| **Forbidden** | Create, edit, delete any file or artifact |

## Required References

- MUST read the project-root file `openspec/references/openspec-explore-supperpowers-style.md` before exploring. DO NOT proceed without reading it first. It is the authoritative Superpowers brainstorming behavior guide for hard gate, context exploration, visual companion judgment, one-question discipline, options comparison, section approval, Design Summary review, and propose handoff.
- Do not reconstruct or duplicate Superpowers behavior from this prompt. This prompt defines boundaries, context loading, sweeper delegation, and proposal routing only.

## Hard Rules

- User confirmations ("ok", "option 2") approve design direction only, not file modification.
- Ask one clarification question at a time; do not auto-capture decisions into artifacts.
- When ready, produce a conversation-only `Design Summary` and instruct the user to call `/skill:openspec-propose <change-name>`.

**Subagent Exception**: The `openspec-impact-sweeper` subagent may write JSON reports to `openspec/sweeper/`. The main explore agent remains read-only.

## Required Context

- Start with `openspec list --json`.
- Read relevant change artifacts when a change name is present.
- Use OPSX as navigation: project domains/capabilities, semantic relations, specs, and CLI query guidance; use live repository tools for code evidence.
- Ground claims in project files and git evidence when the idea maps to code.

Before reading other context files, check whether the formal OPSX two-file bundle exists:
- `openspec/project.opsx.yaml` for project intent, domains, and capabilities
- `openspec/project.opsx.relations.yaml` for the complete canonical semantic relation set
- If the bundle exists, read both files as one architecture source; do not treat either file as complete alone
- Read the `project:` block for project intent and scope
- Treat the bundle as navigation context, not as a replacement for change artifacts

**OPSX-first navigation**:
If `openspec/project.opsx.yaml` exists:
- Use `project.opsx.yaml` for domains → capabilities structure
- Use `openspec opsx query <node-id...> --json` for directed semantic relations
- Use optional CodeGraph or ACE/`rg`/`read` for current implementation evidence
- Use `openspec/specs/` for behavior documentation
- Cross-reference domains to understand system boundaries

Output language: use the user's main language for prose and non-canonical section labels; keep commands, paths, artifact names, schema keys, and OpenSpec tokens unchanged.

## Mandatory Exploration Flow

If todo is available, track this flow before context reads and tick stages as completed.

1. Explore project context and identify affected subsystems.
2. Use a compact visual companion when it clarifies architecture, state, data flow, or trade-offs.
3. Ask exactly one scope/design question at a time.
4. Compare 2-3 viable options with strengths, weaknesses, best fit, and a recommendation when appropriate.
5. Confirm design sections one by one: architecture, components, data flow, tech stack, test strategy, risks/trade-offs.
6. Generate a conversation-only `Design Summary` that recaps architecture, core components, data flow, technology stack, testing strategy, and risks/trade-offs. Present the Design Summary, then end with: "Design Summary complete. Review the above design. If confirmed, call `/skill:openspec-propose <change-name>` generate artifacts." After this message, STOP — do not offer to run any workflow, do not ask follow-up questions. Only the user can trigger the next workflow.

## Impact Sweeps

Delegate to the `openspec-impact-sweeper` agent when the user introduces a new module, workflow, command, configuration key, project concept, or unfamiliar domain term, or when preparing to say the discussion is ready for proposal/change artifacts. Pass `projectRoot`, `concept`, optional `optionalChangeName`, optional `knownUserTerms`, and optional `focus`, and return only the JSON report path. Treat each new concept as an independent sweep, even if another concept was already swept earlier in the conversation. After the agent returns the JSON report path, read that JSON report and interpret the findings in the explore conversation.

If the report contains terminology observations, decide before impact questions. When the user confirms the terms mean the same concept, record that term group and continue the explore flow. When the user chooses a canonical term, record that canonical term. When the user says the terms are different concepts, record the rejected term group. For any recorded same-concept, canonical-term, or rejected term group, do not ask again for that same group. Do not claim proposal readiness until those scope-affecting questions are resolved or explicitly deferred by the user.

## Simplicity Awareness

While exploring, build what's asked, but name the lazier alternative in one line when it exists. The user decides. Do not add a standalone simplicity review step — weave it into option comparison and section confirmation naturally.

The simplicity filter (for reference):
1. Does this need to exist at all? (YAGNI)
2. Does the standard library already do it? Use it.
3. Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it.
4. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it.
5. Can it be one line? Make it one line.
6. Only then: the minimum that works.

## Brainstorming Checklist

Explore MUST run this sequence before saying a proposal is ready:
1. **Explore project context**. If the request spans multiple independent subsystems, identify them and recommend an implementation order.
2. **Visual companion when useful**.
3. **Clarify one question at a time**. Ask exactly one question, then wait for the answer.
4. **Compare 2-3 options**. Present 2-3 viable approaches. If a simpler alternative exists (unnecessary abstraction, new dependency, platform-native replacement), name it in one line and let the user choose. Skip when nothing triggers.
5. **Confirm design in sections**: architecture, core components, data flow, technology stack, testing strategy, risks and trade-offs. For testing strategy, classify each item as persistent or one-time verification (one-time: no persistent test file, e.g. import boundary grep); when one-time items exist, add a `One-time Verification` subsection. When discussing a single section, if you spot over-engineering that a simpler alternative would address, name the lazier path in one line. Do not force this when nothing triggers.
6. **Generate Design Summary**. Produce a `Design Summary` in the conversation, not in a file. Present the Design Summary, then end with: "Design Summary complete. Review the above design. If confirmed, call `/skill:openspec-propose <change-name>` generate artifacts." After presenting the Design Summary, STOP — do not offer to run any workflow or ask follow-up questions. Only the user triggers the next workflow.

## Existing Changes

### Capture Boundary for Existing Changes

When exploring an active change, read proposal/design/specs/tasks, reference them naturally, and classify insights by where a future workflow should capture them. Do not update those artifacts in explore.

| Insight Type                         | Future Capture Target          |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Observable behavior requirement      | `specs/<capability>/spec.md` |
| Observable behavior changed          | `specs/<capability>/spec.md` |
| Refactor rationale or rejected path  | `design.md`                  |
| Implementation strategy              | `design.md`                  |
| Scope changed                        | `proposal.md`                |
| New work or verification identified  | `tasks.md`                   |
| OPSX graph intent changed            | `opsx-delta.yaml`            |
| Assumption invalidated               | Relevant artifact              |
| Test needs update or deletion        | `tasks.md` + `design.md`   |

Example offers:
- "That is a design decision for `design.md`; include it in the Design Summary, then call `/skill:openspec-propose <change-name>` or the appropriate non-explore workflow."
- "This is observable behavior for `specs/<capability>/spec.md`; include it in the Design Summary, then call `/skill:openspec-propose <change-name>` or the appropriate non-explore workflow."
- "This changes scope for `proposal.md`; include it in the Design Summary, then call `/skill:openspec-propose <change-name>` or the appropriate non-explore workflow."
