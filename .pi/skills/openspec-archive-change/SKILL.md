Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**OPSX Compilation Philosophy**:
OpenSpec treats human intent → running code as a compilation pipeline: change artifacts (proposal/specs/design/tasks) are the source code; the agent is the compiler; `openspec validate` is static analysis; verify Phase 1 (reviewer) is the semantic-check pass; verify Phase 2 (optimizer) is the optimization pass; sync + archive is linking and release; OPSX YAML is the symbol table and module graph; snack is decompilation. Rules that follow:
1. Artifacts are source code and MUST be elegant: every sentence is consumed downstream; redundant restatement is a code smell — state each fact exactly once.
2. Complete = faithful + elicited: key decisions the user never stated are undefined behavior in the source, and implementations deviate exactly in those silent gaps. Make them explicit — ask, or record them as explicit assumptions. Never guess silently.
3. Faithful translation: a compiler MUST NOT invent instructions. Do not exceed or deviate from specs; behavior not covered by specs goes back into specs first.
4. Syntax is contract: keep canonical headings, IDs, schema keys, and normative keywords verbatim, or downstream parsers fail.
5. No dead-code output: no placeholders, no empty template sections, no repeated narration — content either carries intent or does not exist.
6. Not compiled until gates pass: validate/verify/seal are pipeline stages, not optional extras.
A single compilation is faithful and deterministic; the source itself iterates freely and recompiles fast.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

Before archiving, run `openspec config project --json` and consume git policy from its normalized project config: `git.commitMessage.archive`, `git.commitMessage.merge`, `git.merge.strategy`, and `git.branch.deleteAfterArchive`; do not parse raw YAML inside the skill.

**Steps**

1. **Select change**
   If no clear change name is provided, run `openspec list --json`, show active changes with schema, and ask. Do not guess.

2. **Unified Full Verify Gate**
   Run `openspec verify status "<change-name>" --json`. Treat `freshness.status` as the sole signal for rerunning full verify: only `MISSING` or `STALE` enters Step 2.5. MUST NOT infer staleness from `checks`, `details`, or `information`. A `FRESH` result after seal MUST reuse Phase 1 even when Git HEAD information differs. For a fresh result, resolve incompatible optimization states separately: complete `PENDING_VERIFICATION` through the appropriate `openspec verify phase2` call, and hard-stop `ABORTED_UNSAFE` for manual recovery.

2.5. **Execute Full Verify**

   When the verify result is missing or stale, execute the same verify contract as `/opsx:verify` using the `subagent-orchestrated` skeleton:
   - Determine `changeName`, absolute `changeDir`, and absolute `projectRoot`
   - Delegate to clean-context generated `openspec-reviewer` subagent with `context: "fresh"`; pass only `changeName`, `changeDir`, `projectRoot`, and the explicit evidence bundle required for canonical Phase 1
   - Validate the reviewer payload, apply only deterministic `tasks.md` write-back in the main workspace, and persist the canonical Phase 1 payload
   - Execute the verify workflow end-to-end; when Phase 2 is eligible, delegate to clean-context generated `openspec-optimizer` subagent with `context: "fresh"`, pass only `changeName`, `changeDir`, and `projectRoot`, validate its finding reconciliation envelope, and let the master implement only the selected finding with TDD
   - In `P1_SPECULATIVE_FENCE`, delegate to clean-context generated `openspec-reviewer` subagent again with `context: "fresh"` to verify specs and the selected finding's preservationConstraints, not optimization value
   - The top-level archive flow MUST NOT inline a current-agent review skeleton or silently downgrade to reread mode
   Continue through Phase 2 when eligible; `SKIPPED` is valid only for config/user skip. Persist fresh verify before archiving.

3. **Check artifact completion status**
   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`. Warn and confirm before proceeding if any artifact is not `done`.

4. **Check task completion status**
   Read `tasks.md`; warn and confirm before proceeding if incomplete checkboxes remain. Missing tasks are not a task-related blocker.

5. **Assess delta sync state**
   If delta specs or `opsx-delta.yaml` exist, assess whether sync is required. The archive CLI performs verify, sync, and move-to-archive; do not duplicate sync writes manually.

6. **Run archive CLI**
   Run `openspec archive "<change-name>"` after the verify gate is fresh. CLI only verifies, syncs, moves the change to archive, and prints the git handoff reminder. CLI MUST NOT create commits, merge branches, switch branches, delete branches, remove worktrees, or generate commit messages.

7. **Git handoff**
   Read the archive CLI output and the projected git policy from `openspec config project --json`. Summary fields include change name, schema, archive location, verify gate result, specs / OPSX sync result, agent-owned git follow-up status, and merge strategy.

8. **Agent git flow**
   The agent continues the post-archive git flow. First handle the implementation boundary before OpenSpec/docs archive artifacts. If uncommitted real project implementation changes remain, create a normal implementation commit that contains only those changes. Then always create a semantic boundary commit with `git commit --allow-empty`; this boundary commit may be intentionally empty when the effective implementation diff is already carried by retained `wip: opt-*` checkpoint commits. If `git.commitMessage.boundary` is set, read that project-relative path; otherwise read the project-root file `openspec/references/openspec-boundary-commit-message.md`. Use that template to build the boundary commit message and run `git commit -F -` for the boundary commit. If `git.commitMessage.archive` is set, read that project-relative path; otherwise read the project-root file `openspec/references/openspec-archive-commit-message.md`. Use that template before creating the OpenSpec/docs archive commit, add only archive/synced paths, and run `git commit -F -`. If a merge or squash commit message is needed, prepare it from the configured or built-in merge template. If `git.commitMessage.merge` is set, read that project-relative path; otherwise read the project-root file `openspec/references/openspec-merge-summary-message.md`. Apply `git.merge.strategy` with `git merge --no-ff`, `git merge --ff-only`, or `git merge --squash` as appropriate. Use `git.branch.deleteAfterArchive` only after confirming the branch is merged with `git branch --merged`. Build paths with `path.join()`, `path.resolve()`, and `path.normalize()`.

9. **Display summary**
   Include change, schema, archive location, verify gate result, specs / OPSX sync result, agent-owned git follow-up status, Merge Strategy, cleanup responsibility, verify reuse/reexecution, and warnings. Do not report that CLI created an archive commit, performed a merge, or deleted a feature branch.

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Verify Gate:** Fresh PASS or PASS_WITH_WARNINGS result confirmed
**Specs / OPSX:** ✓ Synced to main specs and project OPSX (or "No deltas" or "Sync gate bypassed with --no-sync")
**Agent Git Follow-up:** <completed / pending with reason>
**Merge Strategy:** <git.merge.strategy>
**Cleanup Responsibility:** <agent>

Archive completed after satisfying the unified full verify gate.
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Prioritize the standard verify gate; only pass `--no-verify` to the archive CLI when the user explicitly requests it (the CLI provides its own confirmation prompt)
- Show clearly whether verify was reused or re-executed
- In `core`, use `openspec sync "<change-name>"` rather than manual inline sync
- If delta specs or `opsx-delta.yaml` exist, always run the shared sync assessment before moving the change directory
