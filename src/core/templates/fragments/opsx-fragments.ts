export const OPSX_COMPILATION_PHILOSOPHY = `
**OPSX Compilation Philosophy**:
OpenSpec treats human intent → running code as a compilation pipeline: change artifacts (proposal/specs/design/tasks) are the source code; the agent is the compiler; \`openspec validate\` is static analysis; verify Phase 1 (reviewer) is the semantic-check pass; verify Phase 2 (optimizer) is the optimization pass; sync + archive is linking and release; OPSX YAML is the symbol table and module graph; snack is decompilation. Rules that follow:
1. Artifacts are source code and MUST be elegant: every sentence is consumed downstream; redundant restatement is a code smell — state each fact exactly once.
2. Complete = faithful + elicited: key decisions the user never stated are undefined behavior in the source, and implementations deviate exactly in those silent gaps. Make them explicit — ask, or record them as explicit assumptions. Never guess silently.
3. Faithful translation: a compiler MUST NOT invent instructions. Do not exceed or deviate from specs; behavior not covered by specs goes back into specs first.
4. Syntax is contract: keep canonical headings, IDs, schema keys, and normative keywords verbatim, or downstream parsers fail.
5. No dead-code output: no placeholders, no empty template sections, no repeated narration — content either carries intent or does not exist.
6. Not compiled until gates pass: validate/verify/seal are pipeline stages, not optional extras.
A single compilation is faithful and deterministic; the source itself iterates freely and recompiles fast.

- For known or affected OPSX node IDs, run \`openspec opsx query <node-id...> --json\` to get node details, relations and code-map refs in one batch; add \`--depth 2\` when broader related context is needed.

- Use the returned \`template\`, \`instruction\`, and \`outputPath\` to generate \`opsx-delta.yaml\`
- Read \`proposal.md\` to extract the capability list
- Read all delta specs in \`openspec/changes/<name>/specs/*/spec.md\`
- For existing capability or domain IDs, run \`openspec opsx query <node-id...> --json\` for current-system context in one batch; add \`--depth 2\` when related context is needed
- Treat \`ADDED\`, \`MODIFIED\`, and \`REMOVED\` as YAML object keys, not Markdown headings
- Follow a concrete YAML object structure such as:
  \`\`\`yaml
  schema_version: 1
  ADDED:
    capabilities:
      - id: cap.example.feature
        type: capability
        intent: Describe the new capability
    relations:
      - from: cap.example.feature
        type: contains
        to: dom.example
  MODIFIED:
    capabilities:
      - id: cap.example.existing
        intent: Updated intent text
  REMOVED:
    capabilities:
      - id: cap.example.legacy
  \`\`\`
- Delta nodes contain only id, type, intent, status — no code_refs or spec_refs
- Keep this agent-driven: capture merge intent in the YAML, not in programmatic code

/**

export const OPSX_POST_PROPOSE_VALIDATION = `
**Run post-propose warning validation**:
- This validation is warning-only. Do NOT turn \`/opsx:propose\` into a blocking gate.
- Validate generated change specs against the same contract used by downstream change delta validation:
  - Prefer \`openspec validate "<name>" --type change --json\` when available
  - Align with \`Validator.validateChangeDeltaSpecs()\` semantics for delta sections, SHALL/MUST requirement text, and required \`#### Scenario:\` blocks
- Validate \`opsx-delta.yaml\` through the same programmatic CLI path used by downstream change validation:
  - Prefer \`openspec validate "<name>" --type change --json\` when available
  - Align with \`Validator.validateOpsxDelta()\` semantics for Zod parsing, dry-run \`applyOpsxDelta()\`, referential integrity, and code-map integrity
  - Do NOT run \`openspec sync\` for this check because it mutates project files
  - If \`openspec/project.opsx.yaml\` does not exist, \`Validator.validateOpsxDelta()\` skips this check and the final summary must report the skip
- Run lightweight structure checks for \`proposal.md\`, \`design.md\`, and \`tasks.md\` against the current schema templates, not scattered examples:
  - Read \`openspec instructions proposal --change "<name>" --json\`, \`openspec instructions design --change "<name>" --json\`, and \`openspec instructions tasks --change "<name>" --json\`
  - Check only key required headings and checkbox structure
  - For \`tasks.md\`, run a deterministic task structure check equivalent to \`validateTaskStructure\` in \`src/core/parsers/task-structure.ts\`
  - Programmatically verify either legacy \`Actions\`/\`Checks\` sections or coarse \`### Task N:\` sections with \`Goal\`, \`Files\`, \`Requirements\`, and nested \`Checks\`
  - For legacy tasks, verify \`A\`-prefixed action checkboxes, \`C\`-prefixed check checkboxes, required \`Covers:\` fields, valid \`Covers:\` references, and every action covered by at least one check
  - For coarse tasks, verify each task has no more than 5 requirements and at least one nested \`C\`-prefixed check
  - For every check, verify required non-empty \`Verifies:\` or \`Preserves:\` field
  - When \`Verifies:\` anchors an ordinary requirement, verify change-local \`Verifies:\` spec paths plus Requirement/Scenario references when local change specs exist
  - When \`Verifies:\` anchors a REMOVED requirement, verify it uses \`REMOVED Requirement "<name>"\` syntax (no Scenario required) and the REMOVED requirement exists in the delta spec
  - When \`Preserves:\` is present, verify it uses main spec path (\`openspec/specs/<cap>/spec.md\`) with Requirement and ≥1 Scenario names, and the path whitelist does not relax \`Verifies:\` constraints
  - Verify at least one \`Command:\`, \`Evidence:\`, or \`Expect:\` field per check
  - Do NOT invent semantic lint rules beyond the current templates
  - Do NOT judge whether a check is semantically sufficient; defer semantic suitability to verify/reviewer
- If warnings are found, do exactly one repair pass on the generated artifacts, then re-check once
- Final summary MUST separate:
  - fixed warnings
  - remaining warnings
  - skipped checks
- Even with remaining warnings, you MAY still declare the change ready for \`/opsx:apply\`, but disclose the residual issues explicitly
